# A BDD-based Boolean Function Complementation Method

## description: 
this is the programming assignment 2 of VE527 @ UM-SJTU Joint Institute.
the purpose of this assignment is to implement the algorithm of finding Complement

## algorithm:
please note that the algorithm used in this implementation is not the same as the project description and thus does not necessarily has the exact same output.

and my algorithm is as following:

1. read the sop from input file
2. convert the SOP to BDD
3. change all the leaf node 0 to 1, and 1 to 0
4. convert the BDD back to SOP.

## remark
the contribution of this implementation contains:
1. a extention of the original SOP to BDD function in `abc`, implemented using c++11 standard.
2. implement few effective algorithms to reduce the size of SOP, includes:
    - minterm hashing
    - better purning strategy
    - more accurate entropy calculation (finding the best pivot)
